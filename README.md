# ECE176_finalproject

Hello! This is my final project for ECE 176. My project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Specifically, I built and trained a few different models of varying complexity to compare how they do on 2 different datasets (FER-2013 and RAF-DB). Two of these model incorporate Squeeze-and-Excite blocks as an attentional mechanism to improve accuracy.
